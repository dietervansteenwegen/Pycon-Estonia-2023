# Presentation tips/tricks

## Slides

* Many people have trouble reading light text on a dark background. It may work for you on your laptop screen, but projected in front of the audience in a dark room is a completely different story. Use a white or other light background color with high contrast dark text in a large font. [1]
* Use more slides with less code per slide in order to increase your font size. Wrapping lines to make them less than 80 columns helps with the size, too. [1]
* One way to make the slides and the talk work together is to ramble through your talk a few times, recording it, then organize your slides off of that. [1]
* “Tell em what you are going to tell em, tell em, and then tell em that you told em.” [1]
* After I have a solid outline, I begin writing my talk as if it's a blog post. This helps me make sure that the talk will have a story arc, enough supporting information to get my points across, and I will know what I'll be saying in each section within the exposition. Additionally, this helps me make sure that things are in a logical order with smooth transitions between them. [2]
* If you use a lot of references, set up a blog post/repo as a reference for your audience.
* The first few seconds decide whether folks will be excited about your talk and pay attention, or rather pack out their laptop and check their emails. What I’ve found to work well for me is starting with a mission. I.e. I’ll often present a specific problem and make the case for how listening to that talk will help to address that problem. [3]
* Don’t lead with your personal introduction; if you’re known in the field, people don’t care. And if you’re not, well, they probably also won’t care. In any case, telling much about yourself is not what will attract people to your talk. I usually have a very brief intro slide after discussing the mission or key learnings. [3]
* Other storytelling techniques can be employed to great effect as well, such as doing a quick wrap-up when finishing a key section of your session, or adding little "side quests" for things you really want to mention but which are not strictly related to the main storyline. [3]
* What I personally like to have on slides the most is diagrams, charts, sketches, and the like. Anything visual really. [3]
* I’ve found it works great if you circle back to a point you made earlier during a talk. The most apparent way of doing this is coming back to the mission statement you set out for the talk at the beginning. You should be able to make the point that the things you presented actually satisfy that original mission. Or you have some sort of catch phrase to which you cycle back a few times, repetition can help to drive home a point. Just don’t overdo it. [3]
* This is the second critical point: I have to come up with a compelling story using the material I’ve collected. Enumerating facts and wisdom a good talk doesn’t make. It has to have a good flow that makes sense and that keeps people engaged.[4]
* I have a very strong opinion on slides: use few, big words. Don’t make people read your slides unless it’s code samples. [4]
* For photos, I like Unsplash. If I don’t find anything there, I search flickr for CC-licensed material. I credit all creators – whether the license requires it or not – on my talk page. [4]
* Have a final slide with URL/reference that you can keep on the screen when you're finished, possibly including QR code.

## Questions for the organisation

* What type of presentation (format) will be accepted (Powerpoint? Just PDF?)
* Will the talk be recorded? [2]
* If using your own laptop: what video connection is expected?
* Will I have access to presenter view?

## Before

* The backdrops are generally black so don’t wear dark clothes. On video it can look like you it is just your head bobbing around by itself. Steve Jobs can get away with it because he has a professional lighting crew, you don’t. [1]
* Turn off or silence your own mobile phone and in general remove any large objects from your pockets which make it look like you are hiding your next bottle of beer in there. [1]
* If it is you first time around, it may be worth going to a local interest group or somesuch to practice your talk in front of a small audience. [1]
* Bring your own presenter dongle and your presentation on a thumb drive, in several formats. [1]
* Print out your slides or notes.
* I also prepare the talk page with all the material I talk about including continuative topics. I find URLs and credits on slides pointless and distracting, so I dedicate them a proper page. [4]

## Right before

* Remove your conference lanyard. It can distract you, you will play with it, or it will get caught in your wireless microphone and cause problems. [1]
* Disconnect yourself from the network, shutdown all applications besides the presentation software. Temporarily turn off any notifications, or sources of notifications. [1]
* Bring a bottle of water.

## During

* DO speak loudly! This naturally makes you slow down and enunciate your words more clearly. It also makes you seem and feel more confident. It’s very hard to listen to a talk, even from a very knowledgeable person, who is talking too quietly and mumbling words. It’s amazing what effect it has on your confidence too... [1]
* Consider finishing your talk early for extra question time. Then prepare some bonus material in case people run out of questions. See [this blog comment](http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/02/my-tips-for-speaking.html?showComment=1298707361851#c1683303240097254596).

## Q & A

* During the Q&A portion of the talk, always repeat any questions that were asked without a microphone - otherwise many people in the audience won’t hear the question. [1]
